Solar System Simulation
This project is a 3D simulation of our solar system using OpenGL. It features a detailed representation of the Sun, planets, and their moons, complete with textures, orbital movements, and rotations.
Features
Realistic 3D models of the Sun, planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto), and Earth's moon
Textured surfaces for all celestial bodies
Accurate orbital paths and rotations based on real astronomical data
Dynamic lighting with the Sun as the light source
Interactive camera controls for exploration
Adjustable simulation speed
Background starfield for added realism
Bonus Features
Axial tilt for planets
Satellite orbiting Earth
